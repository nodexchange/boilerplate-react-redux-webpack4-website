    "description": "Thanks to the close collaboration with the Irish Independent website team, we could achieve a truly unique way of emotionally engaging their audience with the AIB brand. Our initial conversations made it clear that wallpaper formats combined with banners as static homepage takeovers, rarely produce any form of satisfying results for the advertiser. We wanted to challenge that. Make sure to visit the demo page (link above) and click on the advert to understand the Quartile approach to the traditional formats.",

    "description": "When we were reviewing client's provided assets, the challenge was clear; How to intuitively offer the user a premium full-screen experience with the brand without compromising publisher's content and pushing the article below the viewable fold. We wanted to stay clear of traditional overlays, intrusive blocks that are overlayed on top of the crucial publisher's material. Our solution was to focus on the unique reveal animation that helps users understand emotional connection between the content and the website. We have created a visually astounding flip effect of the whole page that reveals client's large scale advertisement.",

Through the use of vibrant colours and impressive 360 car animation, we achieved nearly 45% engagement rate, making it evident that our visual approach helped Toyota to reconnect with the targetted audience.",
